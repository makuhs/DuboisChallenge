# #DuboisChallenge
Contributions to the weekly challenges from the Data Visualization Society to explore the work of W.E.B Dubois — a Black American civil rights activist, sociologist and writer—by recreating the visualizations from the 1900 Paris Exposition using modern tools

Full project details can be found here: 
https://github.com/ajstarks/dubois-data-portraits/blob/master/challenge/2024 

I am challenging myself to replicate all graphics as close as possible entirely in R using ```#ggplot2```  --  ❌ no post-processing ❌
